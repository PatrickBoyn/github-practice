#About My Web Scraper

This is a web scraper I wrote primarily for use on WordReference to grab words and definitions off of the page to save myself the time and effort of constantly typing
the same thing over and over again.  The core of the code is not mine, however the function and class I created with it is. Essentially what it does is goes to a website, copies some amount of data in between html tags and pastes them into a text file, if one does not exist already it will create it for you. 

#Installation

To install, just download the file and run it. One day I hope to add a GUI to the program and make it simpler to use.

##How to use it

This is specifically geared to one website, feel free to change it up if you want to use it for another purpose. **Do not copy** someones data illegally with this.
